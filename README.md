# code-refactor-pro

In order to fulfill the User Story, I broke down the Acceptance Criteria into a checklist. 

So, to be able to meet accessibility standards, I took apart what sections had to edited/added to establish accessibility for all users. 

First - 
I went over the HTML source code. 
Through that, I added:
    1)  A title (Line 7)
    2) Alt Text for all img (Line 32, 39, 46, 59, 67, 75)
    3) Added a <header class> tag to the body (Line 11/26)
    4) Added a <section class> tag (Line 74/79)
    5) Rearranged heading attribute into sequence order (Line 75)
